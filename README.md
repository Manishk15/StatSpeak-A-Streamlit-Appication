## Problem Statement
It is quite common for businesses and individuals to struggle to make decisions and understand the vast 
amounts of data stored within a spreadsheet in a data-driven society today. While tools such as Excel are 
very strong, their ability to generate real insight requires technical competence in SQL or processing data. 
This is a significant challenge for the non-technical user, who will be barred from their ability to use data 
to make informed decisions. It becomes more challenging in a multilingual environment where users 
might not speak SQL or English fluently, which makes data analysis and decision-making even harder to 
attempt. Current solutions are insufficient to provide an easy-to-use, clear interface that is accommodating 
for different kinds of linguistics and provides precise insights instantly. 
StatsSpeak—A Multilingual Conversational BI—is trying to bridge this gap. This will allow end-users to 
communicate with their Excel sheets using natural language queries. It facilitates the creation of SQL 
queries, analysis of datasets, and visualization of results effortlessly by incorporating leading-edge AI, 
natural language processing, and multilingual support. It opens to a vast audience, being multilingual and 
non-technical, to easily accessed effective and accurate data tools.

## Description
Using LLMs for natural language-driven data analysis, this research aims to create an intelligent 
multilingual conversational business intelligence system. To provide actionable insights from 
structured information, like Excel files or relational databases, users will be able to communicate 
with the system in the language of their choice. It will allow for querying, visualization, and 
concise explanations of insights, putting BI within reach of a more dispersed audience, including 
non-technical individuals. Major areas of emphasis include support for a number of languages, 
seamless data source integration, interactive visualizations, and robust query processing.
